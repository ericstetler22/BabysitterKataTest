README # BabysitterKataTest 11-13-18

The Babysitter Kata test can be ran on any IDE, however, use IntelliJ for the best results.

There were 7 tests created to calculate the rate of how much the babysitter would make on any given night.

The first test creates an index for time entry that would be used for start time and end time.  The entry must be in "##AM" or "##PM" format (ex: 09PM or 04AM).  The time is the only argument that the test takes.

The second test accepts the start time and responds with an approval or denied message.  The time is the only argument the test takes and the entry must be in the same time format as test one.

The third test accepts the end time and responds with an approval or denied message.  The time is the only argument the test takes and the entry must be in the same time format as test one.

The fourth test accepts the calculation for the payment from family A.  The test takes arguments for the start and end time.  Again, must be in the same time format.  The test passes the calculation amount.

The fifth test accepts the calculation for the payment from family B.  The test takes arguments for the start and end time.  Again, must be in the same time format.  The test passes the calculation amount.

The sixth test accepts the calculation for the payment from family C.  The test takes arguments for the start and end time.  Again, must be in the same time format.  The test passes the calculation amount.

The final test accepts the final calculation for the babysitting payment.  The test takes three agurments: start time, end time, and which family.  The start and end time must be in the same time format.  The family choice is just one character; A, B, or C to represent the family choice.  The test passes the calculation amount.
